# Enums and Pattern Matching

## Model States as Enums

```rust
// Good: Impossible states are unrepresentable
enum ConnectionState {
    Disconnected,
    Connecting { attempt: u32 },
    Connected { session_id: String },
    Failed { reason: String, retries: u32 },
}

fn handle(state: &ConnectionState) {
    match state {
        ConnectionState::Disconnected => connect(),
        ConnectionState::Connecting { attempt } if *attempt > 3 => abort(),
        ConnectionState::Connecting { .. } => wait(),
        ConnectionState::Connected { session_id } => use_session(session_id),
        ConnectionState::Failed { retries, .. } if *retries < 5 => retry(),
        ConnectionState::Failed { reason, .. } => log_failure(reason),
    }
}
```

## Exhaustive Matching — No Catch-All for Business Logic

```rust
// Good: Handle every variant explicitly
match command {
    Command::Start => start_service(),
    Command::Stop => stop_service(),
    Command::Restart => restart_service(),
    // Adding a new variant forces handling here
}

// Bad: Wildcard hides new variants
match command {
    Command::Start => start_service(),
    _ => {} // Silently ignores Stop, Restart, and future variants
}
```

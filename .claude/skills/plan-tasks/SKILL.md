# Plan Tasks from PRD

Create implementation tasks from PRD documents.

## Workflow

### 1. List available PRDs

```bash
./scripts/list-prds.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
ls -1 .local/prds/wip/ 2>/dev/null || ls -1 .local/prds/backlog/ 2>/dev/null
```

If no PRDs found, inform user and stop.

### 2. Select PRD

Use `AskUserQuestion` with available PRD files as options.

### 3. Analyze PRD

Read the full PRD. Extract:
- Capabilities and features
- Module structure
- Dependency graph
- Implementation phases

### 4. Create tasks

Use `TaskCreate` for each task. Follow these rules:

**Task qualities**:
- **Atomic**: Single focused change
- **Self-contained**: All context in description
- **Sequenced**: Dependencies explicit
- **Unambiguous**: No decisions left to implementer

**Task description format**:
```
{What to do}

Location: {file paths or how to find them}

Details:
- {specific requirement 1}
- {specific requirement 2}

Verify: {how to confirm it's done}
```

### 5. Set dependencies

Use `TaskUpdate` with `addBlockedBy` to link dependent tasks.

Follow PRD's dependency graph:
- Phase 0 tasks: no blockers
- Phase 1 tasks: blocked by Phase 0
- etc.

### 6. Report summary

Output:
- Total tasks created
- Execution order (phases)
- Any PRD ambiguities needing clarification

## Granularity Guide

| Too coarse | Properly granular |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Add user authentication" | "Create User model with email, passwordHash in src/models/" |
| "Build the API" | "Add POST /users endpoint accepting {email, password}, return 201" |
| "Handle errors" | "Add try/catch in UserService.create(), throw ServiceError on failure" |

See `references/task-examples.md` for more examples.

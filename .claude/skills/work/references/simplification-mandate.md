# Simplification Mandate (step 5.7 reviewer-prompt appendix)

Append this block **verbatim** to every per-task code-reviewer prompt (see
`SKILL.md` step 5.7). It ships inside the prompt, so it must stay
self-contained.

> Beyond bugs, actively hunt for simplification in the diff under review. For
> every added or changed file, ask "what would make this simpler to read
> without changing what it does?" and flag concrete behavior-preserving
> opportunities to: reduce complexity (needless indirection, dead branches,
> single-caller abstractions, nesting deeper than 4 levels, functions over 50
> lines); eliminate redundancy (logic duplicated within the diff or against
> existing code, a helper that reimplements a stdlib or existing utility);
> improve naming (names that state intent, no opaque abbreviations); and
> remove dead code. Follow CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md conventions and the
> surrounding code's style.
>
> Classify a concrete behavior-preserving simplification as **Important**, not
> Minor — Minor findings are not fixed in this loop. Give file:line, the
> current shape, and the simpler replacement.
>
> Do not over-simplify: never propose a change that trades clarity for
> brevity, drops error handling, collapses a deliberate boundary, or removes a
> documented invariant. Simpler means easier to read and maintain, not shorter
> at any cost. If a change would alter behavior, it is out of scope — do not
> flag it.

# Work Through Tasks

Implement pending tasks one-by-one, committing after each completion.

## Tool Selection

Choose the right tool based on task domain:

| Domain | Tool | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Backend, APIs, business logic | Codex | Strong at algorithms, data flow, system design |
| Frontend, UI, visual design | Gemini | Better aesthetic judgment, visual coherence |
| Mixed (e.g., full-stack feature) | Split task or use both sequentially |

### Gemini-first tasks

Use `use-gemini` skill when the task involves:

- **Color palettes** - selection, theming, contrast
- **Layouts** - page structure, spacing, visual hierarchy
- **Components** - buttons, forms, cards, any UI elements
- **Typography** - font choices, sizing, readability
- **Animations/transitions** - motion design, timing
- **Responsive design** - breakpoints, mobile adaptation
- **Any user-facing surface** - web pages, GUI, dashboards

### Gemini as design authority

For visual tasks, Gemini can challenge existing specs:

1. Share the planned design/spec with Gemini
2. Ask for critical review before implementation
3. **Trust Gemini's feedback** on visual matters - it has better taste
4. Adjust the plan based on its recommendations
5. Then proceed with implementation

Example prompt addition for visual tasks:
```
Before implementing, critically review this design spec.
Suggest improvements to colors, spacing, typography, or layout.
Challenge anything that feels generic or could be more distinctive.
```

### Codex-first tasks

Use `use-codex` skill when the task involves:

- Database schemas, migrations
- API endpoints, business logic
- Authentication, authorization
- Data processing, algorithms
- Testing, CI/CD configuration
- Backend infrastructure

## Workflow

### 1. Get pending tasks

Use `TaskList` tool to see all tasks. Filter for:
- Status: `pending`
- No blockers (empty `blockedBy`)
- No owner assigned

### 2. Claim and start task

For the first available task:
1. Use `TaskUpdate` to set `status: in_progress` and claim ownership
2. Use `TaskGet` to read full task description

### 3. Select and invoke tool

**Determine task domain** (see Tool Selection above), then:

**For Codex tasks:**
- Model: `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` (default) or user preference
- Reasoning: `medium` (default)
- Sandbox: `workspace-write` for code changes
- See `references/codex-integration.md`

**For Gemini tasks:**
- Permissions: `--allow-all-tools` for code changes
- Mode: `-p` for non-interactive
- See `references/gemini-integration.md`

### 4. Handle result

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Success | Continue to step 5 |
| Timeout | Split task (see below), mark original as blocked |
| Context exceeded | Split task, mark original as blocked |
| Error | Report to user, keep task in_progress |

### 5. Commit changes

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
```

Commit message rules:
- Conventional commit format
- One line, no period
- Reference task ID if available

### 6. Mark complete and continue

1. Use `TaskUpdate` to set `status: completed`
2. Return to step 1 for next task
3. Stop when no pending tasks remain

## Task Splitting

When a tool can't complete a task (timeout/context), split it:

1. Analyze what was accomplished
2. Create 2-4 smaller tasks covering remaining work
3. Use `TaskCreate` for each subtask
4. Set dependencies with `TaskUpdate.addBlockedBy` if sequential
5. Mark original task as blocked or completed (if partially done)

### Split criteria

| Original scope | Split into |
|----------------|------------|
| Multiple files | One task per file |
| Multiple features | One task per feature |
| Large refactor | Extract → transform → cleanup |
| Full-stack feature | Backend task (Codex) → Frontend task (Gemini) |

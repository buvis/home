description: Implement pending tasks using Codex, committing after each task
---

Use Codex to implement all pending tasks completely, proceeding one task at time that will fit in its context (otherwise review your plan and breakdown tasks that Codex fails to complete due to timeout or running out of context). Commit changes to the repository after each task is completed with conventional commit message that fits on one line, but is descriptive enough to understand what was done. Then proceed to next task without asking me for approval.

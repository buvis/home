description: Implement taskmaster tasks using Codex, committing after each subtask
---

Use Codex to implement all Tasks completely, proceeding one subtask at time that will fit in its context (otherwise review your plan and breakdown subtask that Codex fails to complete due to timeout or running out of context). Commit changes to the repository after each subtask is completed with conventional commit message that fits on one line, but is descriptive enough to understand what was done. Then proceed to next subtask without asking me for approval.

# Review-Work-Completion Rubric

This rubric defines binary pass/fail criteria for consensus review of completed work. Each rule is numbered and stable for tracking coverage. Reviewers must answer "R{n}: pass|fail" for every rule in their prompt.

## Rules

### Tests

R1: Tests cover every new behavior introduced by the diff.
R2: Tests bind to intent, not just observable behavior.
R3: No skipped or xfail tests mask failures.

### Integration

R4: Changed components integrate with existing callers.

### Security

R6: No hardcoded secrets in the codebase.
R7: All user input is validated and sanitized.
R8: No injection-unsafe queries or commands.

### Domain

R9: Implementation matches PRD feature behavior exactly.
R10: Error handling is explicit and not swallowed.
R11: No debug statements, TODOs, or placeholder markers remain.

### Code Quality

R12: Function sizes respect the 50-line limit.
R13: File sizes respect the 800-line limit.

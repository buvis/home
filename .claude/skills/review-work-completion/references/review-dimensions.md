# Review Dimensions

Detailed checklist for reviewing completed work.

## Plan Compliance

- [ ] Implementation matches task description
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No scope creep (extra features not requested)
- [ ] No missing pieces from original task

## PRD Coverage

- [ ] All "must have" requirements addressed
- [ ] Success metrics achievable with implementation
- [ ] No PRD sections left unimplemented
- [ ] Dependencies correctly handled

## Simplification

Hunt actively for simplification — do not just tick boxes. The diff under
review is fresh; this is the cheapest moment to cut complexity before it sets.
For every added or changed file, ask "what would make this simpler to read
without changing what it does?" and flag concrete opportunities.

- [ ] **Reduce complexity** — no needless indirection, dead branches, or
      abstractions built for a single caller; nesting <= 4 levels; functions
      under 50 lines
- [ ] **Eliminate redundancy** — no logic duplicated within the diff or against
      existing code; no helper that reimplements a stdlib or existing utility
- [ ] **Improve naming** — names state intent; no opaque abbreviations;
      action-named functions start with a verb
- [ ] **Follow project standards** — conventions from CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md and
      the surrounding code; no style drift
- [ ] **No dead code** — no commented-out blocks, unused imports, variables, or
      speculatively-added parameters
- [ ] **Appropriate error handling** — explicit, never silently swallowed

**How to flag a simplification:** give the file:line, the current shape, and
the simpler replacement. Flag concrete behavior-preserving simplifications at
🟡 Medium so the decision gate routes them into the rework loop. Do not inflate
them to 🟠 High; that floods the rework loop and can trip the scope alarm.

**Balance — do not over-simplify:** never propose a change that trades clarity
for brevity, drops error handling, collapses a deliberate boundary, or removes
a documented invariant. Simpler means easier to read and maintain, not shorter
at any cost. If a "simplification" would change behavior, it is out of scope —
do not flag it.

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for new logic
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested
- [ ] Integration tests if crossing boundaries
- [ ] Tests actually run and pass

## Security

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation at boundaries
- [ ] No SQL/command injection risks
- [ ] Auth/authz correctly applied
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged

## Documentation

- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes noted

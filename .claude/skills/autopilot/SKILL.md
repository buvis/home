description: Orchestrate full PRD lifecycle autonomously — catchup, planning, work, review, and rework loops. Chains existing skills, tracks state, makes safe decisions autonomously, pauses only when human judgment is needed. Processes PRDs one per session (wip first, then backlog). Use when ready to execute a PRD end-to-end. Triggers on "autopilot", "run autopilot", "autopilot status", "auto pilot", "run the full cycle", "execute PRD end to end", "drain backlog".

# Autopilot

Orchestrate the full PRD lifecycle: catchup → plan-tasks → work → review → rework loop → doubt review → done.

Makes autonomous decisions backed by research (dependencies, recurring issues, API/schema changes when PRD-driven) and pauses only for critical security, requirements ambiguity, or blocking decisions.

## Entry Points

- `/autopilot` — auto-select PRD (wip first, then backlog), run full cycle
- `/autopilot <prd-filename>` — full cycle with specific PRD
- `/autopilot status` — print current dashboard, no action

If invoked with `status`, read `.local/autopilot/state.json`, print phase/cycle/task summary, and stop.

## State Management

All autopilot artifacts live under `.local/autopilot/`, organized by type:

```
.local/autopilot/
  state.json                              # current cycle state
  signal                                  # transient, used by stop hook
  reports/{batch_id}-report.md            # batch audit report
  deferred/{batch_id}-deferred.json       # unresolved items across PRDs
```

State file: `.local/autopilot/state.json` — see `references/state-schema.md` for schema.

Create `.local/autopilot/` and subdirectories if missing. Initialize state file at PRD selection. Update state at every phase transition.

### Resuming

When `/autopilot` is invoked and `.local/autopilot/state.json` exists with `batch.completed_prds`, this is a continuation after a session restart. Preserve `batch.completed_prds` (including `batch.id`) and proceed to Phase 0 to pick the next PRD.

Clean up stale signal file at start: delete `.local/autopilot/signal` if it exists.

### Task Counts

At every state update, query `TaskList` and write current counts to the state file:
- `tasks_total` — number of tasks (pending + in_progress + completed)
- `tasks_completed` — number of tasks with status completed

This keeps the dashboard progress bar accurate.

### Live Dashboard

The user can run `pidash` (from buvis-gems) in a separate terminal pane to watch progress in real time. It watches `.local/autopilot/state.json` automatically — no action needed from autopilot beyond keeping the state file updated.

### Phase Banners

Print a banner at each phase transition:

```
── AUTOPILOT ── PRD: {prd-name} ── Phase: {PHASE} ──────────────────
── AUTOPILOT ── PRD: {prd-name} ── Phase: REVIEW ── Cycle {n} ─────
── AUTOPILOT ── PAUSED ── {n} issue(s) need your decision ──────────
── AUTOPILOT ── PRD: {prd-name} ── DONE ── {n} cycles ─────────────
```

## Phase 0: PRD Selection

1. If argument provided, find that PRD in `.local/prds/wip/` or `.local/prds/backlog/`. If found in backlog, `mv` to `wip/`.
2. Otherwise, auto-select:
   a. Check `.local/prds/wip/`:
      - 1 found → auto-select, announce
      - 2+ found → ask user which one
   b. If wip is empty, check `.local/prds/backlog/`:
      - PRDs available → auto-pick lowest sequence number, `mv` to `wip/`
      - Empty → STOP: "No PRDs found. Create one with /save-plan."
3. Initialize `batch` in state file if not already present: `id: "<yyyymmddHHMM>"` (current timestamp), `mode: "autopilot"`, `completed_prds: []`
4. Initialize/update state with selected PRD, preserve `batch` field
5. Print progress:
   ```
   ── AUTOPILOT ── PRD {n}: {prd-name} ─────────────────────────────
   ```
   Where `{n}` = `len(batch.completed_prds) + 1`

## Phase 1: Catchup

**Skip if:** `"catchup"` in `phases_completed` in state file.

Invoke `/catchup` skill.

After completion, update state: add `"catchup"` to `phases_completed`, set `phase: "planning"`.

## Phase 2: Planning

**Skip if:** `TaskList` returns any pending or completed tasks (tasks already exist).

Invoke `/plan-tasks` with the selected PRD.

After completion, query `TaskList` and update state: add `"planning"` to `phases_completed`, set `phase: "work"`, write `tasks`/`tasks_total`/`tasks_completed` snapshot (see Phase 3 for format).

## Phase 3: Work

**Skip if:** All tasks completed, none pending.

Before invoking `/work`, query `TaskList` and write the full task snapshot to `.local/autopilot/state.json`:
- `tasks_total`: total count
- `tasks_completed`: completed count
- `tasks`: array of `{"id": "<task-id>", "name": "<title>", "status": "pending|in_progress|completed"}` for EVERY task

**Include the task `id` field** — a PostToolUse hook on TaskUpdate uses it to automatically sync status changes to the dashboard. This is mandatory.

Invoke `/work` skill. It runs until all tasks complete.

After completion, query `TaskList` again and update state: add `"work"` to `phases_completed`, set `phase: "review"`, write updated `tasks`/`tasks_total`/`tasks_completed`.

## Phase 4: Review

**Skip if:** Review file exists in `.local/reviews/` for current cycle (check filename pattern `{prd-name}-review-{cycle}.md`).

Invoke `/review-work-completion` skill.

After completion, update state: set `phase: "decision-gate"`.

## Phase 5: Decision Gate

Read the review output. Categorize each finding using `references/decision-framework.md`.

### Safety Checks — evaluate BEFORE classifying individual issues:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Cycle 3 reached | PAUSE: escalate ALL remaining issues regardless of severity |
| >10 follow-up tasks from review | PAUSE: scope alarm — ask user before proceeding |
| Issue count not decreasing vs previous cycle | PAUSE: escalate immediately — fixes aren't working |
| Same issue reappearing after previous fix | Route to research-then-decide Protocol B |
| A sub-skill errored during this cycle | PAUSE: report error, don't retry automatically |

### Classification (per finding):

**Auto-fix** (proceed without asking):
- Low severity, any consensus
- Medium severity, clear mechanical fix
- Medium severity, 1/3 consensus
- Any severity where fix is additive only (adds code/tests, doesn't modify signatures/types/schemas)

**Research-then-decide** (run protocol, then auto-fix or defer):
- New dependency needed -> Protocol A from `references/decision-framework.md`
- Recurring issue (appeared in previous cycle) -> Protocol B
- High + data model change -> Protocol C
- High + touches public API -> Protocol D

Execute the research protocol. If verdict is "proceed", treat as auto-fix. If verdict is "escalate", defer to batch end. Log with full `research` field in either case.

**Defer to batch end** (log, don't PAUSE):
- Critical severity, always
- Requirements ambiguity (PRD says X, code does Y)
- Research-failed items (verdict "escalate" from research protocols)

**PAUSE** (present to user, block progress):
- >10 follow-up tasks from review (scope alarm)
- Cycle 3 reached (hard stop)
- Decision blocks subsequent tasks (e.g. API shape needed before frontend can proceed)
- Data model choice that all remaining work depends on

Log every decision in state file (`autonomous_decisions` or `deferred_decisions`).

### Outcomes:

- **All auto-fixable, no deferrals, no blockers** → proceed to Phase 6
- **Has deferrals but no blockers** → log deferred items to `.local/autopilot/deferred/{batch_id}-deferred.json`, proceed to Phase 6 with auto-fixable items only
- **Has blocking escalation** → PAUSE. Present only the blocking issue(s) to user. Wait for decision. After user responds, proceed to Phase 6.
- **No issues found** → proceed to Phase 7 (Doubt Review)

## Phase 6: Rework

Tag follow-up tasks from review findings with `[C{cycle}]` prefix and tasks from decision-gate resolutions with `[D{cycle}]` prefix. Both use the current cycle number.

Before invoking `/work`, update state with current task counts.

Invoke `/work` on follow-up tasks (auto-fixable ones + user-approved ones only).

The work skill may parallelize independent rework tasks when `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` is available (see work skill's "Parallel dispatch for independent rework fixes").

Increment cycle counter. Update state: set `phase: "review"`, update task counts. Loop back to Phase 4.

## Phase 7: Doubt Review

**Skip if:** `"doubt-review"` in `phases_completed` in state file.

Final sanity check before completion. Invoke `/review-with-doubt`.

After the review produces findings:

1. For each concrete weakness, missing test, edge case, or flaw identified:
   - Create a task tagged with `[DOUBT]` prefix
   - Add an entry to `doubts` in the state file: `{"description": "...", "severity": "low|medium|high|critical", "status": "pending"}`
2. If no actionable findings (confidence >= 8, no concrete issues) → skip to Phase 8
3. If >5 doubt tasks created → PAUSE: "Doubt review flagged {n} issues after review cycle passed. Review the list before proceeding."
4. Otherwise, invoke `/work` on the `[DOUBT]`-tagged tasks immediately — no decision gate, no rework loop
5. After work completes, mark each doubt entry's `status` as `"resolved"` in the state file
6. Update state: add `"doubt-review"` to `phases_completed`, set `phase: "done"`, update task counts

This phase runs once per PRD. It does not loop back to Phase 4.

## Phase 8: Completion

1. Update state: set `phase: "done"`
2. Move PRD from `wip/` to `done/` (use `mv`, keep `00XXX-` prefix)
3. Append completed PRD to `batch.completed_prds` in state file
4. Delete all tasks from the completed PRD: query `TaskList`, mark every task as `deleted` via `TaskUpdate`. This prevents stale tasks from triggering Phase 2's skip logic on the next PRD.
5. Append items to `.local/autopilot/deferred/{batch_id}-deferred.json` (create if missing). Collect from the current state file:
   - `deferred_decisions` with status `"pending"` or `"deferred"` -> type `"deferred_decision"`
   - `doubts` with status `"pending"` -> type `"doubt"`
   - `autonomous_decisions` with `research` field -> type `"autonomous_research"` (for user awareness at batch end)
   Each entry gets tagged with `prd` (filename) and `cycle`. Preserve the full `research` field when present - this is the only copy that survives state reset. Skip this step if nothing to write.
6. Append PRD summary to `.local/autopilot/reports/{batch_id}-report.md` (create with header if missing). See `references/batch-report-format.md` for format.
7. Print per-PRD summary:

```
── AUTOPILOT ── PRD: {prd-name} ── DONE ── {n} cycles ─────────────

Summary:
- Cycles: {n}
- Autonomous decisions: {count}
- Escalated decisions: {count}
- Follow-up tasks fixed: {count}
```

### Continuation

8. Check: any PRDs remaining in `.local/prds/wip/*.md` or `.local/prds/backlog/*.md`?
   - **Yes** → reset state for next PRD: set `phases_completed` to `[]`, `cycle` to `1`, clear tasks/decisions/review_cycles/doubts. Preserve `batch` field. Write `next` to `.local/autopilot/signal`. Print:
     ```
     ── AUTOPILOT ── {prd-name} done ── next PRD in new session ────────
     ```
     Then **STOP**. The stop hook auto-exits the session. The shell loop starts a fresh session.
   - **No** → print batch summary, delete state file. Do NOT write `.local/autopilot/signal` - the session stays interactive for batch-end review.
     ```
     ── AUTOPILOT ── COMPLETE ───────────────────────────────────────────

     Completed {n} PRDs:
       1. {prd-name} ({cycles} cycles)
       2. {prd-name} ({cycles} cycles)
       ...
     ```

     ### Batch-End Review

     Before exiting, collect ALL pending items from across the batch and present them to the user. This is mandatory if any items exist - never auto-exit with unreviewed items.

     **Source:** `.local/autopilot/deferred/{batch_id}-deferred.json` (single source of truth - all items were written here at Phase 8 step 5 of each PRD). Contains three item types:
     - `deferred_decision` - issues that failed research or were deferred for other reasons
     - `doubt` - unresolved findings from doubt review
     - `autonomous_research` - research-backed decisions made autonomously (for user awareness)

     **Presentation format - chunked by PRD:**

     Present items grouped by PRD, one PRD at a time. For each PRD chunk:

     ```
     ── BATCH REVIEW ── PRD: {prd-name} ── {n} items ──────────────────

     DEFERRED DECISIONS ({count}):

     1. {severity emoji} {issue description}
        Cycle: {n} | Consensus: {consensus}
        Context: {why this was deferred - include research evidence if available}
        File: {path}
        Options: fix now / create issue / ignore

     2. ...

     UNRESOLVED DOUBTS ({count}):

     1. {severity emoji} {doubt description}
        Context: {what the doubt review found and why it matters}
        Options: fix now / create issue / ignore

     AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH DECISIONS ({count} - for awareness):

     1. {severity emoji} {issue description} -> {action taken}
        Research: {evidence_summary from research field}
        (No action needed unless you disagree)
     ```

     Wait for user decisions on each PRD chunk before showing the next. For "fix now" items, execute the fix before continuing. For "create issue", create a GitHub issue with the context shown.

     After all PRD chunks are reviewed (or user says stop), delete the deferred JSON and write `done` to `.local/autopilot/signal`.
     If the deferred JSON doesn't exist or is empty, write `done` to `.local/autopilot/signal` immediately.
     The stop hook auto-exits the session. The shell loop sees `done` and stops.

## Session Loop

Autopilot supports automatic session cycling via a signal file + Stop hook. This enables unattended PRD-to-PRD transitions while keeping sessions interactive.

**Signal file:** `.local/autopilot/signal` — written at Phase 8 completion with `next` (more PRDs) or `done` (backlog empty).

**Shell wrapper:**

```bash
while true; do
  claude "/autopilot"
  signal=$(cat .local/autopilot/signal 2>/dev/null)
  rm -f .local/autopilot/signal
  if [ "$signal" != "next" ]; then
    echo "Backlog drained."
    break
  fi
  echo "Starting next PRD..."
done
```

**Required:** A Stop hook that auto-exits when the signal file exists. See `scripts/autopilot-stop-hook.sh`. Configure in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "command": "~/.claude/skills/autopilot/scripts/autopilot-stop-hook.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Without the hook, sessions remain interactive but require manual exit (Ctrl+D) between PRDs. The shell loop still handles restart.

## Shell Command Rules

- **Never chain commands** with `&&`, `|`, or `;` in a single Bash call. Use separate Bash tool calls instead.
- **Never use redirections** like `2>/dev/null`. Handle missing files by checking existence or catching errors in the tool result.
- Use `Glob` or `Read` instead of `ls` where possible (e.g. to check if files exist or list directory contents).
- Use `mkdir -p` in its own Bash call when creating directories.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Sub-skill invocation fails | PAUSE, report which skill failed and error |
| No PRDs anywhere | STOP with message about /save-plan |
| State file corrupted | Delete it, restart from Phase 0 |
| Review produces no parseable output | PAUSE, report — don't retry |
| All three reviewers fail | PAUSE, report — partial results usable if user confirms |
| `.local/` doesn't exist | Create it |
| Task tools unavailable | STOP, report — can't operate without tasks |

## Superpowers Integration

Autopilot depends on superpowers for quality gates. All integrations are conditional - autopilot works without them, but quality improves with them.

### Used by the Work skill (Phases 3, 6, 7)

| Superpower | Step | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `test-driven-development` | 2.7 | Write failing tests before implementation |
| `systematic-debugging` | 4.5 | Root-cause analysis on errors |
| `verification-before-completion` | 5.5 | Run test suite before marking done |
| `requesting-code-review` | 5.7 | Per-task code review after commit |
| `receiving-code-review` | 5.7 | Evaluate review feedback before acting on it |

### Used in Phase 6 (Rework)

| Superpower | Condition | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | 2+ independent rework tasks | Parallelize isolated review fixes |

### Not used (rationale)

| Superpower | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `brainstorming` | Interactive; happens before PRD exists |
| `writing-plans` | PRD is the plan; plan-tasks decomposes into tasks |
| `executing-plans` | Work skill manages per-task dispatch already |
| `subagent-driven-development` | Work skill's loop serves same purpose |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | Autopilot works on current branch, not worktrees |
| `using-git-worktrees` | Separate architectural concern |
| `using-superpowers` | Session-start meta-skill; autopilot is autonomous, not conversational |
| `writing-skills` | Meta-skill for creating skills, not a workflow gate |

### Note on review layering

Per-task review (step 5.7) and PRD-level review (Phase 4) are complementary, not redundant. Per-task catches issues early before they compound across tasks. Phase 4 catches cross-task coherence, requirement coverage, and integration issues. Both are needed.

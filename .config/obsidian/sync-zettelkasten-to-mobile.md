# Synchronize Zettelkasten to Mobile Devices

After bad experience using a-shell and Working Copy, I switched to using Obsidian Sync.

Community plugins activations aren't synchronized across devices, so you have to activate them manually on each device. Never activate Omnisearch plugin on iOS devices, it will cause Obsidian to crash.

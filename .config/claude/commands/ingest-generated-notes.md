# Ingest generated notes

Process AI generated notes in my Zettelkasten inbox.

## Process

Use zettelmaster skill to process INBOX_DIR=`~/bim/inbox/automated/generated-notes/` into SYNTHETIC_DIR=`~/bim/zettagen/` and referring to PROCESSED_DIR=`~/bim/zettelkasten/`. Links between zettels must be relative to LINKS_ROOT=`~/bim`. After processing the unstructured notes, move them to ARCHIVE_DIR=`~/bim/reference/40-archives/generated-notes` keeping the directory structure as it was in INBOX_DIR.

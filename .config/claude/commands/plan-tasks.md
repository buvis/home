1. Use the task-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from my PRDs in .taskmaster/docs/
2. Expand all tasks into subtasks
3. Analyze tasks Complexity
4. Further expand tasks/subtasks that are too complex to handle

At any point, you should ask me for clarifications when in doubts. Always explain the possible options and the context so well that nobody familiar with the project would understand your question.

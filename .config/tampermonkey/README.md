### Use Templater template to create new note

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites installed:
   - Templater plugin for Obsidian
   - a tepplate in your vault (e.g. `siebel.tpl`)
   - Advanced URI plugin for Obsidian
2. Add hotkey for the template (you don't need to assign a hotkey actually, but this is needed to create a command for that particular template)
3. In Tampermonkey, configure Templater template name
